# BooksWagonProject
Here we are going to do automating the bookswagon application in which we will be doing by step by step and also doing endtoend testing.
First we are going to do signup into the application
Next we are going to do login in to the application 
And Then we are going to search for that particular book either by the author name or book name
Next we are adding the particular book into wishlist 
And next step is going to buy  that particular which you had preferred book
From there we are going to click on the place order button here we have to change the quantity  and next we click on the continue button and after the filling the entrie address 
Selecting the payment method which you would like to prefer and click on the subimit there by the endtoend testing will be completed
And we are doing with some invalid scenarios and checking it by using validations
In  this project we had used log4net,allure test reports and also added the validations to every testcase.
Here we are using the hybrid framework where we will be using the Nunit,POM,PageFactory and Datadriven Framework
